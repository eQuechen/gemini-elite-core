# Task Plan: Skill Refactoring and Optimization

## Goal
Establish a high-standard strategy for creating powerful skills and refactor all existing project skills to meet this standard, incorporating updated documentation and real-world examples.

## Phases
- [x] Phase 1: Research and Analysis
    - [x] Explore https://github.com/mgd34msu/goodvibes-plugin/tree/main to identify skill structure patterns.
    - [x] Analyze local skills in `skills/` to identify weaknesses and brevity.
- [x] Phase 2: Strategy Definition
    - [x] Create `SKILL_OPTIMIZATION_STRATEGY.md` with mandatory rules and tactics.
- [x] Phase 3: Audit and Roadmap
    - [x] Create `SKILL_REFACTOR_TODO.md` with a detailed list of tasks for each local skill.
- [x] Phase 4: Refactoring Execution (Iterative per Skill)
    - [x] **Step 4.1: Comparative Analysis**: next16-expert compared with ref repo.
    - [x] **Step 4.2: 2026 Research**: Next.js 16.1.1 + React 19.2 documented.
    - [x] **Step 4.3: Implementation**: Refactored `next16-expert` (~500+ lines total).
    - [x] **Step 4.4: Refactor `react-expert`**: 1000+ lines with React 19.2 + Compiler + PPR.
    - [x] **Step 4.5: Refactor `tailwind4-expert`**: 400+ lines with Oxide engine, @theme, and Container Queries.
    - [x] **Step 4.6: Refactor `supabase-expert`**: 500+ lines with SSR, Revocable Keys, and Splinter AI.
    - [x] **Step 4.7: Refactor `zustand-expert`**: 400+ lines with Zustand v5, Slices Pattern, and SSR safety.
    - [x] **Step 4.8: Refactor `prisma-expert`**: 500+ lines with Prisma 7, TypedSQL, and Edge-first architecture.
    - [x] **Step 4.9: Refactor `auth-expert`, `ai-pro`, `api-pro`, `architect-pro`, `archive-searcher`**: Advanced 2026 suites.
    - [x] **Step 4.10: Refactor `browser-use-expert`**: Integrated official 2026 documentation.
    - [x] **Step 4.11: Refactor `artifact-janitor`**: 400+ lines with safety protocols and automation.
    - [x] **Step 4.12: Refactor `docs-pro`**: 500+ lines with style guide and AI patterns.
    - [x] **Step 4.13: Refactor `gemini-sdk-expert`**: 500+ lines with structured output and context caching.
    - [ ] **Step 4.14: Completion & Commit**: Update plans, report to user, and commit upon approval.

## Key Questions
1. What specific structural elements make the reference repository's skills superior?
2. Which local skills are the most outdated or critically brief?
3. What is the latest documentation for the key libraries (Next.js 16, React 19, etc.) mentioned in the skills?

## Status
**Currently in Phase 1** - Starting research on the reference repository.

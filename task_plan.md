## Key Questions
1. What specific structural elements make the reference repository's skills superior?
2. Which local skills are the most outdated or critically brief?
3. What is the latest documentation for the key libraries (Next.js 16, React 19, etc.) mentioned in the skills?

## Status
**🚀 All Skills Refactored to 2026 Standard of Excellence.**

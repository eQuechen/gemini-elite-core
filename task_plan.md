## Key Questions
1. What specific structural elements make the reference repository's skills superior?
2. Which local skills are the most outdated or critically brief?
3. What is the latest documentation for the key libraries (Next.js 16, React 19, etc.) mentioned in the skills?

## Status
**Currently in Phase 1** - Starting research on the reference repository.

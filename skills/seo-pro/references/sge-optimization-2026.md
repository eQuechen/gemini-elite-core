# SGE Optimization: Ranking in AI Overviews (2026)

Google's Search Generative Experience (SGE) uses LLMs to synthesize answers directly in the search results. Visibility in these summaries is the primary goal of SEO in 2026.

## 1. Scannable Answer Boxes

AI models extract information from structured, scannable text.
-   **Standard**: Use H2/H3 headings that are direct questions (e.g., "How does X work?").
-   **Format**: Follow the question with a 1-2 sentence direct answer before expanding.

## 2. Entity Extraction Optimization

AI searches for "Entities" (People, Places, Things, Concepts) and their relationships.
-   **Action**: Explicitly define your core entity in the first paragraph.
-   **Action**: Use Schema.org markup to provide a machine-readable map of your entities.

## 3. Topical Depth vs. Width

SGE favors content that covers a topic from multiple angles (Semantic SEO).
-   **The 360-Degree Rule**: Don't just explain "What it is." Explain "How it compares," "Common pitfalls," and "Real-world examples."

## 4. Question-Based and LSI Keywords

-   **Question Keywords**: "What are the benefits of...", "Step-by-step guide to...".
-   **LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing)**: Include natural variations and related terms (e.g., if writing about "React," include "Hooks," "Virtual DOM," "Fiber").

## 5. Visual Data Insights

SGE can extract insights from infographics and tables.
-   **Standard**: Include at least one data table or chart per long-form article.
-   **Metadata**: Ensure all images have high-fidelity `alt` text describing the *insight* of the image, not just the content.

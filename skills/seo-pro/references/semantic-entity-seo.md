# Semantic Entity SEO: Beyond Keywords (2026)

Semantic SEO focuses on user intent and the relationships between concepts, rather than simple keyword density.

## 1. The Intent Map

Map every page to a specific user intent:
-   `Informational`: "How to bake a cake."
-   `Commercial`: "Best ovens 2026."
-   `Transactional`: "Buy GE Oven Model X."

## 2. Topic Clusters

Group related content around a central "Pillar."
-   **Internal Linking**: Links should flow from the "Clusters" to the "Pillar" and back, creating a semantic web of authority.

## 3. Schema.org for Entities

Use structured data to explicitly define entities for Google's Knowledge Graph.
-   **Organization Schema**: Define who you are.
-   **Product Schema**: Define what you sell.
-   **FAQ Schema**: Define the questions you answer.

## 4. NLP-Friendly Writing

Write in a way that is easy for Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to parse.
-   **Active Sentences**: Subject -> Verb -> Object.
-   **LSI Terms**: Naturally include terms that always appear in high-quality discussions of your topic.

## 5. Continuous Freshness

AI search favors the most recent data.
-   **Update Protocol**: Refresh critical articles every 6 months with the latest stats, tools, and best practices.

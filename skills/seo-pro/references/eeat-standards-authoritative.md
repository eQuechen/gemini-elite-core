# E-E-A-T Standards: Building Authoritative Content (2026)

Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trust (E-E-A-T) are the filters Google uses to separate human-quality expertise from generic AI-generated fluff.

## 1. Experience (The "I" Factor)

Google favors content that demonstrates first-hand experience.
-   **Standard**: Use personal pronouns ("In our testing," "I found that...").
-   **Evidence**: Include unique screenshots, case study data, or proprietary research.

## 2. Expertise

-   **Author Bios**: Every major article must have a detailed author bio with credentials, links to other published work, and social proof.
-   **Review Cycles**: High-stakes content (Health, Finance) must be reviewed by a subject matter expert and labeled as "SME Reviewed."

## 3. Authoritativeness

-   **The Pillar Strategy**: Build "Pillar Pages" (3,000+ words) that establish your site as the definitive source for a specific topic cluster.
-   **Backlink Health**: Focus on high-quality citations from reputable domains in your specific industry.

## 4. Trust

-   **Transparency**: Clearly state publishing dates, sources of data, and any affiliations.
-   **Security**: Ensure your site meets all Core Web Vitals and has a robust security posture (HTTPS, valid certificates).

## 5. AI Attribution

In 2026, transparency about AI usage is a trust signal.
-   **Labeling**: "Written by [Author], assisted by [AI Name] for data synthesis."
-   **Validation**: Human verification of all AI-generated facts is mandatory.

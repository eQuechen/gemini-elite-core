## 🏛️ Core SEO Philosophies

1.  **Value over Volume**: One authoritative 3,000-word guide is worth fifty thin 500-word posts.
2.  **Intent is Everything**: Every byte of content must serve a specific user journey (Informational, Commercial, etc.).
3.  **Human Quality, AI Ready**: Write for humans, but structure for bots.
4.  **Trust is the Primary Signal**: Credentials, proprietary research, and security are non-negotiable.
5.  **Data as Content**: Use tables, charts, and infographics to provide structured insights that AI can extract.

## 🚫 The "Do Not" List (Anti-Patterns)

| Anti-Pattern | Why it fails in 2026 | Modern Alternative |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Keyword Stuffing** | Easily detected and penalized by NLP. | Use **LSI & Semantic SEO**. |
| **Generic AI Content** | Buried by E-E-A-T filters. | Use **Experience-Led Content**. |
| **Thin Affiliate Pages** | Zero value in the SGE era. | Build **Topical Pillar Pages**. |
| **Ignoring Core Web Vitals**| Low performance drops rankings. | **Performance-First Design**. |
| **Hidden Entity Schema**| Models can't map your concepts. | Use **Explicit JSON-LD Schema**. |

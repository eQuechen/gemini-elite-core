# Conversational Flow & Contractions

## Writing Like You Talk
Technical writing doesn't have to be clinical. Conversational flow keeps the reader engaged and signals human authorship.

### 1. The Power of Contractions
Contractions (don't, can't, won't, it's) are a simple way to instantly humanize text.
- **Formal**: "It is important that you do not forget the API key."
- **Human**: "Don't forget the API key—it's the only thing keeping the auth flow alive."

### 2. Active Voice vs. Passive Voice
Passive voice (e.g., "The code was written by the agent") is a common machine pattern.
- **Active**: "The agent wrote the code." 
Active voice is clearer, punchier, and more human.

### 3. Direct Address
Use "You" and "We" to create a sense of collaboration.
- **Example**: "We're going to dive into the database schema now, and you'll notice how we scoped the RLS policies."

### 4. The Salami Technique
Break up complex ideas into bite-sized "slices." Avoid paragraphs that exceed 4 sentences. If you have a list of 5 things, use bullet points.

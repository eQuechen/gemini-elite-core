# Storytelling for Technical Docs

## The "Before-After-Bridge" Framework
Every great README or technical guide should follow this narrative structure.

1. **Before (The Pain)**: Describe the world before the solution.
   - *Example*: "You're tired of manually updating 5 different `.env` files across your microservices."
2. **After (The Dream)**: Describe the world after the solution is implemented.
   - *Example*: "Imagine a single source of truth for your secrets, synced across your entire monorepo in sub-seconds."
3. **Bridge (The Solution)**: Show how your tool/skill gets them there.
   - *Example*: "Enter `monorepo-master`: the CLI tool that automates secret orchestration."

## Conflict & Resolution
Introduce a "Villain" (e.g., "Complexity," "Legacy Code," "Manual Tasks") and show how the "Hero" (the user, aided by the skill) defeats it.

## Specificity is the Secret
A story about "scaling a website" is boring. A story about "how we handled 50,000 concurrent users during the Black Friday peak using Next.js Edge Config" is a compelling narrative that proves expertise.

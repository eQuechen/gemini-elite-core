## Proving You Exist
In 2026, content that could have been written by *anyone* will be ranked by *no one*. You must prove your expertise through concrete evidence.

---

### 1. The "I" Factor (Experience)
- **Bad**: "Setting up a monorepo is difficult."
- **Elite**: "Last month, I spent 14 hours migrating a team of 40 developers to Turborepo. Here are the 3 circular dependencies that nearly crashed our build."

### 2. Deep Technical Details (Expertise)
- Mention specific library versions (e.g., "Next.js 16.2.1").
- Reference specific bugs or GH issues (e.g., "This fix handles the hydration mismatch found in issue #48291").
- Provide actual terminal output or log snippets.

### 3. Citations & Links (Authoritativeness)
- Link to official documentation, not generic blog posts.
- Quote recognized industry leaders (with attribution).

### 4. Transparency (Trustworthiness)
- State clearly if any part of the content was AI-assisted.
- Provide "Last Updated" timestamps with high precision.
- Include an "About the Author" section that links to a verified LinkedIn or GitHub profile.

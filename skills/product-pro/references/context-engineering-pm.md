# Context Engineering for Product Management (2026)

Efficient AI assistance requires high-quality context. PMs are the "Curators of Truth" for the AI agents.

## 1. The Persistent Context Workspace

Maintain a central repository of facts that agents can access:
-   **User Personas**: Detailed semantic profiles of target users.
-   **Product Domain**: ubiquitous language and business rules.
-   **Constraints**: Legal, technical, and budgetary limits.

## 2. Agentic Backlog Management

Use agents to:
-   **Cluster User Needs**: Group feedback from thousands of sources into logical themes.
-   **Synthesize Feedback**: Turn raw logs and interviews into "User Stories."
-   **Identify Gaps**: Agents scan the roadmap for logical inconsistencies.

## 3. The "Canonical Example" Rule

When instructing an agent to build a feature, provide one "Gold Standard" PR or component. This is 10x more effective than writing 5 pages of requirements.

## 4. Scenario Scenario Scenario

Ask the agent to generate multiple "Scenarios" for a feature:
-   `Happy Path`: Everything works.
-   `Struggle Path`: User is confused or disconnected.
-   `Exploit Path`: Malicious actor trying to bypass rules.

## 5. Metadata for Traceability

Every PR generated by a PM-led agent should include:
-   `mission_id`: Link to the Conductor track.
-   `rationale`: Why this implementation path was chosen.

# Rapid Agentic Prototyping for PMs (2026)

Product Managers in 2026 use AI agents to validate ideas in days, not months.

## 1. PM-as-Architect

Use tools like **Cursor**, **Lovable**, or **Gemini CLI** to build functional prototypes without deep engineering resources.

-   **Workflow**:
    1.  Describe the feature to an agent.
    2.  Review the generated logic and data schema.
    3.  Iterate on the "UX Vibe" using natural language.

## 2. Stringing APIs Together

Modern prototyping is about **Orchestration**.
-   Connect Gemini (Reasoning) + Stripe (Billing) + Resend (Mail) + Supabase (DB) to build a "Full-Stack Demo."

## 3. Validating the "Magic Moment"

Focus only on the "Magic" feature.
-   Don't build the login page or the settings panel.
-   Build the core AI reasoning loop that provides the most value.

## 4. Scenario Analysis (AI-Simulated Users)

Use LLMs to simulate thousands of "User Personas" interacting with your prototype to find edge cases and logical gaps.

## 5. Transition to Engineering

When the prototype works:
-   **Deliverables**: A functional codebase, a clear PR description, and documented "Edge Cases" found during simulated testing.

# Quality Gate Metrics and KPIs (2026)

Measuring code quality ensures that the system doesn't degrade over time.

## 1. Static Analysis Metrics

-   **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Keep below 10 for functions.
-   **Maintainability Index**: Target 80+.
-   **Cognitive Load**: Use SonarQube's cognitive complexity metric (Target < 15).

## 2. Test Quality Metrics

-   **Code Coverage**: Target 80% overall, 100% for Domain logic.
-   **Mutation Score**: Measure the percentage of mutants (simulated bugs) killed by tests.
-   **Test Execution Time**: CI should complete within 3 minutes for rapid feedback.

## 3. Deployment Reliability

-   **Change Failure Rate**: Percentage of deployments that cause an outage (Target < 1%).
-   **MTTR (Mean Time to Repair)**: Target < 5 minutes for automated rollback.
-   **Deployment Frequency**: Measuring velocity alongside quality.

## 4. Technical Debt Tracking

-   **Debt Ratio**: Ratio of remediation effort to total development effort.
-   **Stale Code**: Automated identification of unused functions and dead branches.

## 5. Agent Performance Score

Rank AI agents based on their success rate:
-   `First-time pass rate`: Percentage of PRs merged without requested changes.
-   `Bug introduction rate`: Bugs found in code generated by a specific agent.

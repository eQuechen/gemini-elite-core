# Standards for AI-Generated Code (2026)

AI-generated code must be held to the same (or higher) standards as human-written code.

## 1. Mimicry vs. Excellence

-   **Mimicry**: The AI repeats the patterns it sees in the codebase (which might be legacy or flawed).
-   **Excellence**: The AI applies the latest idiomatic patterns (Next.js 16.2, React 19.3).
-   **Standard**: AI should aim for **Excellence** while maintaining **Structural Compatibility** with the existing project.

## 2. No "Black Boxes"

AI must explain **WHY** it made a complex decision, not just **WHAT** it did.
-   *Rule*: Include concise JSDoc/TSDoc for any logic that isn't immediately obvious.

## 3. Library Selection

AI often hallucinates library versions or features.
-   **Standard**: Use `web_search` or local documentation to verify APIs.
-   **Mandatory**: Use the project's preferred libraries (e.g., Bun, Zod, Tailwind 4) rather than suggesting new ones.

## 4. Handling Hallucinations

-   **Prop Hallucinations**: Verify all component props exist in the type definition.
-   **Logic Hallucinations**: Run unit tests for every logical branch generated.

## 5. Metadata for Traceability

Tag AI-generated files with metadata for easier future refactoring.

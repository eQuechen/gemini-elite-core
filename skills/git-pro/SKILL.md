# 🤖 Skill: Git Automation (v2.1.0)

## Executive Summary
The `git-automation` expert is responsible for the "Autopilot" layer of the repository. In 2026, manual repository maintenance is a legacy practice. This skill focuses on building robust **GitHub Actions** pipelines, automating **Issue & Project Management**, and leveraging **Git Internals** for deep diagnostics and custom tooling. The goal is a repository that manages itself, allowing engineers to focus on logic rather than plumbing.

## 🚫 The "Do Not" List (Anti-Patterns)

| Anti-Pattern | Why it fails in 2026 | Modern Alternative |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Manual Issue Creation** | Slow and prone to missing context. | Use **MCP Issue Templates**. |
| **Monolithic Workflows** | Hard to maintain and debug. | Use **Reusable Workflows**. |
| **Hardcoded GH Tokens** | Security risk. | Use **OIDC Connect**. |
| **Ignored Garbage** | Bloats repository size over time. | Run **Automated Pruning Scripts**. |
| **Black-Box Internals** | Leads to "Voodoo Debugging." | Study **Git Object Map**. |

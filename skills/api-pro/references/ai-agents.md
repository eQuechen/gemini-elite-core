# Autonomous AI Agents & Model Orchestration (2026)

Integrating the GPT-5 family and o3-deep-research models into production workflows.

## The GPT-5 Family

GPT-5 introduces "Reasoning Tokens" (RT) that allow for complex planning before generating output.

### Integration Pattern: Reasoning vs. Execution
```typescript
import { generateText } from "ai"
import { gpt5 } from "@ai-sdk/openai"

async function solveComplexTask(task: string) {
  // Use GPT-5 for the planning phase
  const plan = await generateText({
    model: gpt5("gpt-5-reasoning"),
    prompt: `Analyze and create a multi-step plan for: ${task}`,
    // Higher maxTokens for the "thought" process
    maxTokens: 4000 
  })

  // Execute steps with specialized agents
  return executePlan(plan.text)
}
```

## o3-deep-research Models

These models are optimized for long-running, iterative data gathering tasks. They are "Autonomous-First".

### Agentic Loop Implementation
```typescript
class ResearchAgent {
  async conductDeepResearch(query: string) {
    const research = await o3.research({
      query,
      maxDepth: 5,
      tools: [webSearch, databaseLookup],
      onProgress: (step) => console.log(`Step ${step.id}: ${step.action}`)
    })

    return research.finalReport
  }
}
```

## Autonomous Agent Best Practices

### 1. State Persistence
Agents must persist their state across turns to handle long-running operations.
```typescript
interface AgentState {
  memory: string[]
  completedTasks: string[]
  currentGoal: string
}
```

### 2. Tool Boundaries
Explicitly define what an agent CANNOT do.
- **NEVER** allow agents to delete production databases without human-in-the-loop (HITL) confirmation.
- **NEVER** expose raw API keys to the agent's context.

### 3. Cost Management (2026)
GPT-5 Reasoning tokens are expensive. Use "Context Compression" techniques to reduce input tokens before passing to the reasoning model.

## Autonomous Workflows
- **Code Refactoring Agent**: GPT-5 with access to `repomix` context.
- **Bug Hunter**: o3-deep-research analyzing logs and trace files.
- **Customer Support**: Autonomous agents with RAG-enhanced memory.
